          <div>
            Welcome to our project page! We are a passionate and dedicated group
            of five students who have come together to create something amazing.

            Our journey began in a course where we were introduced to software
            production techniques and effective project planning. Most of us had
            already some experience with software development, but we were eager
            to learn more and improve our skills. We were tasked with creating a
            project that would demonstrate our understanding of software
            development, and we decided to create a web application that would
            help people find recipes based on their dietary restrictions.
          </div>
          <div>
            Our aim is to not only meet the requirements of the course, but to
            surpass expectations and deliver a final product that showcases our
            expertise, commitment, and passion for software development.

            We hope that our project will inspire and resonate with others, and
            we are excited to share our journey with you. Thank you for taking
            the time to get to know us, and we invite you to explore our project
            further!
